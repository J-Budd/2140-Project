#Names and Descriptors of all classes related to authorised teachers

TODO:
The main teacher screen should display the following:
> Teacher's Name
> The current date
> Reminder to record attendance 
> A showing of due assignments and upcoming assignments (for tomorrow)
Below will be a panel with buttons that redirects the teacher to the following screens:
> Student Records
> Student attendance
> Student assignments

Student Attendance will be designed as the following:
A large table with the headings: Name, Attendance and Note

First and Last names of the students will be automatically loaded under Name

There is a command panel at the bottom with the options: Morning Attendance, Afternoon Attendance and Save and Return.
Morning Attendance button enables user to take register for 7am-12pm. Register can only be taken once;
once it is saved the button is disabled. Button is reenabled next day.
Same for Afternoon Attendance.
If possible, make an option to show a warning on the main teacher screen that attendance
hasn't been taken.
If possible, make an option to view and filter previous attendance based on name and attendance.
(If completed add to requirements doc)
