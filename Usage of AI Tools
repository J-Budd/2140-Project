#Attendance Listing
Chat GPT was used to assist in designing loadAttendance() after numerous errors kept cropping up. It was instructed to maintain the functionality of the user-defined function, and
to use whatever user-defined functions already existed.

#ExpenseManageApp
Chat GPT was used to debug the edit response button function because, after multiple attempts by the team, it would not work. It was given clear instructions on a possible method of fixing the error and then given the other user-defined functions. The response given led to the creation of the
Expense Table Model Class to properly manipulate the new use of the JTable feature.  

#clearDisplayArea function in inventory manager gui
Claude Ai was used to help with clearing the display area after a button was clicked on. The area was constantly being stucked on either the view log or display item.
