#SignUpOrIn
This is the main class for signing up for/signing into the system. SignUpOrIn.java is directly linked to MainEntry.java
which can be found in the system-startup branch.

This java file creates a separate screen dependent on whether the user selected sign up or sign in.

If the user clicked sign up, they will be presented with a username entry field, two Password
entry fields, and a group of radio buttons to select their role. Usernames must be unique and
no less than three characters. Password cannot be less than three characters. Once there is a Principal
any user signing up cannot select the Principal button.

If the user clicked sign in, they will be presented with a username entry field, and a Password
entry field. The system is to scan the UserData folder for a txt file named after the user. From
there it will check if the entered password is correct. It will also check the user's role to
determine what screens the user should have access to. 
A certain screen will be shown dependent on what role the user has
